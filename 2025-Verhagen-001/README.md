\# Livestock herd demography



\*by Philip Verhagen\* 



A NetLogo simulation of livestock herd demography. This module allows you to simulate the population size of a herd of livestock, depending on the slaughter practices applied. Default inputs are provided for cattle husbandry.

\## Further information



This module was originally part of the ROMFARMS model (Joyce 2019) in order to simulate different scenarios of animal husbandry practice in the Dutch Roman frontier zone. The original module focused on understanding the economic viability of stockbreeding of cattle, sheep and horses for the Roman army. In particular slaughter rate proved to be an important parameter for this.



The standard input values used in the submodule are taken from the ROMFARMS source code, and are described and substantiated in Joyce (2019). However, users are free to adapt these values to their own research questions. The original module was developed for a runtime of 100 ticks (years), during which the herd size growth will be relatively modest using these parameters. However, after approx. 400 ticks the herd population will start to grow exponentially.
