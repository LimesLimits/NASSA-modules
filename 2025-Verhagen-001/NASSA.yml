description: >
  This is a submodule providing the code necessary to simulate livestock herd demography, including the effects of slaughter practices. The module was originally part of the ROMFARMS model that was set up to simulate animal husbandry economy on the Dutch Roman frontier, focusing on stockbreeding of cattle, sheep and horses. However, the code can be adapted to different animals, regions and periods.
